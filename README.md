This project is microservices based project which can be dockerized. Service Registry, both microservices and mongo db containers are running fine. Only issue is with
config server. Stull unable to fetch configurations of database from config server.
Angular container is working. 

In config server application, ssh key of git is added which is breach of security so git has revoked that ssh key.
